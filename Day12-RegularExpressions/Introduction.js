/* 
A regular expression or RegExp is a small programming language that helps to find pattern in data. A RegExp can be used to check if some pattern exists in a different data types. To use RegExp in JavaScript either we use RegExp constructor or we can declare a RegExp pattern using two forward slashes followed by a flag. We can create a pattern in two ways.

To declare a string we use a single quote, double quote a backtick to declare a regular expression we use two forward slashes and an optional flag. The flag could be g, i, m, s, u or y.

RegExp parameters
A regular expression takes two parameters. One required search pattern and an optional flag.

Pattern
A pattern could be a text or any form of pattern which some sort of similarity. For instance the word spam in an email could be a pattern we are interested to look for in an email or a phone number format number might be our interest to look for.

Flags
Flags are optional parameters in a regular expression which determine the type of searching. Let us see some of the flags:

g: a global flag which means looking for a pattern in whole text
i: case insensitive flag(it searches for both lowercase and uppercase)
m: multiline
*/

// Creating a pattern with RegExp Constructor
// Declaring regular expression without global flag and case insensitive flag.

// without flag
let pattern = "love";
let regEx = new RegExp(pattern);
console.log(regEx); // /love/

// Declaring regular expression with global flag and case insensitive flag.
let pattern2 = "love";
let flag = "gi";
let regEx2 = new RegExp(pattern2, flag);
console.log(regEx2); // /love/gi

// Declaring a regex pattern using RegExp object.
// Writing the pattern and the flag inside the RegExp constructor

let regEx3 = new RegExp("love", "gi");
console.log(regEx3); // /love/gi

/*

let regEx4 = /love/gi;

console.log("--------------");

// RegExpp Object Methods
// test():Tests for a match in a string. It returns true or false.

const str = "I love JS";
const pattern3 = /love/;
console.log(pattern3);
const result = pattern3.test(str);
console.log(result); // false

/* 
match():Returns an array containing all of the matches, including capturing groups, or
null if no match is found. If we do not use a global flag, match() returns an array containing
the pattern, index, input and group. */

const str2 = "I love JavaScript";
const result2 = str2.match(/love/);
console.log(result2); // ["love", index: 2, input: "I love JavaScript", groups: undefined]

const result3 = str2.match(/love/g);
console.log(result3); // ['love']

// search(): Tests for a match in a string. It returns the index of the match, or -1 if the search fails.
const result4 = str2.search(/love/g);
console.log(result4); //2

// Replacing a substring
// replace(): Executes a search for a match in a string,
// and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring.

  "Python is the most beautiful language that a human begin has ever created. I recommend python for a first programming language";

const replace = txt.replace(/Python|python/, "JS");

console.log(matches); // I am staudent and  I love studying JS

/* 
[]: A set of characters
[a-c] means, a or b or c
[a-z] means, any letter a to z
[A-Z] means, any character A to Z

[0-9] means any number 0 to 9
[A-Za-z0-9] any character which is a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9

r'^substring' eg r'^love', a sentence which starts with a word love
r'[^abc] mean not a, not b, not c.
$: ends with
r'substring$' eg r'love$', sentence ends with a word love
